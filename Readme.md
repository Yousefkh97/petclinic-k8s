# Spring PetClinic Sample Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.png?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/)

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:


```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.
 
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.

You could start MySql locally with whatever installer works for your OS, or with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

Further documentation is provided [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/mysql/petclinic_db_setup_mysql.txt).

## Kubernetes Deployment

The steps to add a Kubernetes deployment:
 1) Create a Dockerfile that builds a new image using the command: "docker build -t petclinic . "
 2) Create a new Repository in Dockerhub named "yousefkh97/petclinic", tag the image from step 1 using "docker tag petclinic yousefkh97/petclinic"
    and push it to Dockerhub using "docker push yousefkh97/petclinic".
 3) Create all related files to kubernetes deployment. you can find all the files in k8s directory. The files are:
 
    3.1) petclinic-deployment.yml : In this file you can find the main deployment with two containers: one for the petclinic app and the other for mysql DB connected to the 
         configmap in order to get the environment variables.
         
    3.2) petclinic-configmap.yml: In this file you can find the environment variables for mysql DB.
    
    3.3) petclinic-service.yml: The service that allows us to connect to the deployment.
